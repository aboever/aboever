### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD Candidate studying biogeochemistry.
My research is focused on aquatic redox chemistry in freshwater and marine systems.
I am most interested in how changes to the redox state of sediments (i.e., subsurface fluids) and water column effect important biogeochemical processes (e.g., microbial respiratory pathways, carbon transformations, and contaminant mobility).

### Future additions:
# continuing with above dialogue
Each of these examples has implications for our health and the health of the planet:
Changes to the redox state are often under hydrologic control and are triggered by rain events.
# Introduce project examples

I'll be adding more info soon!
