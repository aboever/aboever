### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a PhD Candidate studying biogeochemistry.
My research is focused on aquatic redox chemistry in freshwater and marine systems.
I am most interested in how changes to the redox state of sediments (i.e., subsurface fluids) and water column effect important biogeochemical processes (e.g., microbial respiratory pathways, carbon transformations, and contaminant mobility).

I'll be adding more info soon!
